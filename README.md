- Examine correlation between cigarettes per day and health metrics  
- Uncover trends and patterns in blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart rate  
- Identifying age group of heavy smoker

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Python** (`pandas`,`matplotlib`, `Numpy`)  
- **Power BI** for interactive dashboard and KPIs  
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis & visualization  
- Data cleaning and transformation in Python

## 📊 Key Insights
- Smokers tend to have **higher heart rates** but **slightly lower average blood pressure** than non-smokers  
- The correlation between **cigarettes per day and health metrics is weak**, suggesting other variables also influence outcomes  
- Strong **positive correlation between systolic and diastolic blood pressure** regardless of smoking status  
- **Cholesterol levels** remain high in both groups, indicating other contributing lifestyle or genetic factors
